# MagiC-engine

A Winboard and UCI compatible chess engine written in C. 

# Why?

I created MagiC-engine as a tool to help me learn about the C language. 
I really enjoyed writing my own chess program as I was able to combine two of my favourite
hobbies: chess and programming. 

MagiC-engine has a Lichess.org account -> @MagiC-engine 

See you over the board!!!

# Version 2 has been released!

To compile MagiC-engine for yourself, just use the included makefile. Should be pretty straightforward. Only works on Windows. 

I have included a windows binary. (You may not wish to download the executable directly as you will recieve the "this file is not downloaded often and may 
contain viruses" warning, though I must say that I have not purposely put anything dangerous into MagiC-engine.) 

As stated above, you can play against MagiC-engine on Lichess.org by sending a challenge to @MagiC-engine. 

# License

Do whatever you want with MagiC-engine. For example, I used it as a tool for learning C.

Version 1 was heavily based off of VICE: https://www.chessprogramming.org/Vice

While improving version 1 I came across some more websites to learn from, mostly the chessprogramming wiki: https://www.chessprogramming.org/Main_Page

Also interesting to look at is this list of example chess programs and ideas for beginners to experts: https://www.lkessler.com/cclinks.shtml
