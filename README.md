# MagiC-engine v1.0

A simple chess engine written in C. Is UCI compatible. Enjoy!

# Features

The user can change MagiC-engine's parameters:

depth x will set MagiC-engine's calculating depth to x moves

time x will set the movetime to x seconds

setboard x will set the position to FEN x

go will have MagiC-engine play against itself

MagiC-engine will use any opening book named "performance" in the same directory 

MagiC-engine has a Lichess.org account -> @MagiC-engine 

# Future Plans

I will try to improve the evaluation function to make it use its time better, as well as create a checkmate score. 

Version 2 is now in active development!

# License

Do whatever you want with MagiC-engine. For example, I used it as a tool for learning C. Version 2 is coming soon!
