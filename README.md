# MagiC-engine

A Winboard and UCI compatible chess engine written in C. 

# Why?

I created MagiC-engine as a tool to help me learn about the C language. 
I really enjoyed writing my own chess program as I was able to combine two of my favourite
hobbies: chess and programming. 

MagiC-engine has a Lichess.org account -> @MagiC-engine 

See you over the board!!!

# Version 2 has been released!

# License

Do whatever you want with MagiC-engine. For example, I used it as a tool for learning C.
