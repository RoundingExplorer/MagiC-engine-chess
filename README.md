# MagiC-engine v1.0

A simple chess engine written in C. Is UCI compatible. Enjoy!

# Why?

I created MagiC-engine as a tool to help me learn about the C language. 
I really enjoyed writing my own chess program as I was able to combine two of my favourite
hobbies: chess and programming. 

MagiC-engine has a Lichess.org account -> @MagiC-engine 

# Future Plans

I will try to improve the evaluation function to make it use its time better, as well as create a score that measures
distance-to-mate.

Version 2 is now in active development!

# License

Do whatever you want with MagiC-engine. For example, I used it as a tool for learning C.
